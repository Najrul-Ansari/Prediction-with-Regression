# Delivery Ime Prediction - 
The 'Delivery Time Prediction' folder contains the linear regression model build to predict the delivery time on the basis of the sorting time.
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating delivery times based on sorting time to enhance operational efficiency in the delivery process.
Sorting time - In the context of the delivery business, "sorting time" typically refers to the amount of time it takes for a delivery service to organize and arrange packages or items for dispatch or distribution. Sorting is a crucial step in the logistics process, especially in large distribution centers or warehouses where numerous packages need to be sorted based on their destination or delivery route.
